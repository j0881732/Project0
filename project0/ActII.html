            <h2>The Ball</h2> 
            The woman buys the young man a tux and a suit. She takes him to get fitted and makes the arrangements for her. The professor talks to him the next day in class during break and confirms the plans. The young man does not drink, shows up at the professor's house on time and brings her to the ball. He is a gentleman and walks on the inside of the curve, opens every door, entertains her, and has a great night. The older woman #1 arrives with her date and she and the professor buy the young man drinks. Older woman #1 takes plenty of pictures with the young man and almost makes her date feel nonexistent. She even makes her date buy the younger man drinks. The younger man escorts the professor back to her husband who is outside to pick her up. They laugh and the professor thanks him. She is like a mother to the young man and the husband finds an appreciation for him.
